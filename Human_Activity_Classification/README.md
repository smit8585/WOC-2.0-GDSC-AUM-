## Aim

- To show how much accurately the model can classify activities correctly.

# Guideline
- Fork the repository
- do the following in your forked repo:
- create a folder with your name in `/Human_Activity_Classification/` directory.
- for ex: `/Human_Activity_Classification/smit's_solution` 
- Add your files inside the folder that you created.
- for ex: `/Human_Activity_Classification/smit's_solution/filename.py`
- after adding your files and finishing your work, rise a pull request.
